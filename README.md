FreeCodeCamp Header Parser Microservice Project

1. Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/whoami/ and deploy it to Heroku.
2. Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-back-end-development-projects.
3. User Story: I can get the IP address, language and operating system for my browser.
